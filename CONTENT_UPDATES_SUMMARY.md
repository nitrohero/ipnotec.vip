## Date: October 1, 2025

### 🎯 Key Changes Made

All misleading content about "11 spots" has been corrected site-wide to reflect the accurate messaging:

## ✅ Core Concept Clarifications

### **BEFORE (Incorrect):**
- ❌ "Only 11 exclusive spots available"
- ❌ "2,847+ Total I-IDs Created" (exceeded 1,001 limit)
- ❌ "Limited to 11 spots only"
- ❌ Confusing messaging about what "Future 11" means

### **AFTER (Correct):**
- ✅ **Total Seats: 1,001**
- ✅ **Seats Claimed: 108/1,001** (realistic starting number)
- ✅ **Future 11**: Conceptual name for the app (users can have multiple avatars, not limited to 11)
- ✅ **App Launch Date**: January 10, 2026 (gives access to all seat holders)
